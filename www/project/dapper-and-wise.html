<h3>The Site</h3><p>The site is built on <a href="http://getsymphony.com/">Symphony</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and is fully responsive, having optimized views, images, and functionality for computers, tablets, and mobile devices. We opted for single-page site to fit their streamlined content and a desire to keep things simple, clean and modern. On this project I moved their custom iconography and branding into an icon font to deliver crisp images regardless of device size and resolution.</p>
<h3>Custom Photography</h3><p>A centerpiece to this project is the custom on-site photographic work. The D&amp;W guys wanted some beautiful original photography to compliment the clean site and give their audience a good feel for what they are about. All of the photography on their site and much of the photography on their <a href="https://squareup.com/market/dapper-and-wise-roasters">Square store</a> were done on-site as part of this initiative. We were able to successfully capture their signature feel and deliver on bringing their character and personality to the web.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
