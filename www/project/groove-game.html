<p>Ultimately, the game concept was called Groove.</p>
<h3>iOS App Concept</h3><p>My role was to develop the UI and UX of several app screens for the game. This was my first foray into app design and I used Illustrator and Photoshop to develop out the screens. We didn&#39;t focus on onboarding or some of the more standard settings screens that might be featured in a larger project but most of the emphasis was on the main experience of the game.</p>
<p>We tried bringing game mechanics to the interface in a way that was fun, exciting, and would actually encourage drivers to use the game to earn rewards and in-turn drive safer.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
