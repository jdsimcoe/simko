The old site was built on Wordpress and I wanted to move them not just to a better design direction but to a more modern CMS with richer expression.</p>
<h3>Design</h3><p>First, I developed some new concepts for their brand and site. I wanted to make the brand feel more fresh and modern as well as playfully hint at health without overused clich√©s. While the branding wasn&#39;t on the table for redesign I did work at representing PAM (their health survey platform) and Flourish in some creative, branded ways. I also built out mockups in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> for their main site.</p>
<h3>Web</h3><p>For the implementation I worked under the creative direction of <a href="http://www.aaronwalser.com/">Aaron Walser</a> to build Insignia&#39;s site using <a href="http://buildwithcraft.com/">Craft CMS</a>. I started with a styleguide-first approach, building out all of the website modules in a fully-styled Styleguide page and then building the data sections in the CMS rendering pages via templates.</p>
<p>The approach worked well and allowed us to gain consensus on the modules being built and made the templating task much clearer as we knew what kind of data we would ultimately want to live there.</p>
<p>Aaron and his team took my templates and instructions and were able to build all of their own internal pages themselves, with rich expression, live preview, and custom control over the look and feel of their site and pages.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
