My current role is sole Product Designer. I have developed a new branding, look and direction for Circle and have been applying my skills in the design of several iOS apps, their marketing website, print and retail display design, and various other internal projects.</p>
<h3>iOS Apps</h3><p>Working at Circle marks my first major foray into iOS app design. Having developed skills in <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> over the past year I have been able to successfully apply my skills in developing out the UI and UX of several involved applications. I have touched everything from visual design, to experience design, UI layout, scaling across multiple device sizes, and working at prototyping onboarding and motion.</p>
<p>I have used FramerJS in past projects, but have found <a href="https://atomic.io/">Atomic</a> to be a really fast way to explore a design direction and get quick feedback on motion and application flow.</p>
<p>Lots of time has been spent working through the flow of our applications and ensuring that the experience is seamless and easy to walk the user through what would be an otherwise very complicated process.</p>
<h3>Web Design</h3><p>For the marketing website I have forayed into new technologies and ways to build sites that are lean and utilizing some of the latest trends in web design. So far, the site is built using Segment&#39;s <a href="http://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> which is an npm-based build pipeline that has a built-in server with autoreload for testing but also builds SCSS, CommonJS via <a href="http://webpack.github.io/">Webpack</a>. Pushes to GitHub are tested via a <a href="https://wercker.com/">Wercker</a> config and then deployed to either <a href="https://surge.sh/">Surge</a> or Amazon S3 through Wercker. Other employees can edit content through a custom <a href="httsp://prose.io/">Prose</a> config.</p>
<p>Learning these new technologies enables the website to be lean, fast, and solid served to users via static hosting. It is exciting having tools at my fingertips that enable rich, creative expression and allow us to move design forward with better technology.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
