<h3>The Branding</h3><p>For the branding I toyed with the metaphor of a sapling or seed representing Christian growth. Since their goal is to grow young hearts through deep theology set to music I wanted to find a logomark that captured both of these ideas. I began with a leaf icon from a stock icon set that I heavily modified and joined to a musical notation icon, also modified from a stock set. From there, I did several revisions and worked the proportions so that the note had a good harmony and balance between the sprouting leaf. Thus, the new branding for Saplings was burn.</p>
<h3>The Website</h3><p>The site is built on <a href="http://getsymphony.com/">Symphony</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and is fully responsive on computers, tablets, and mobile devices. The site features some complex data sources that manage their music, linkage to various media outlets for purchase, as well as the status of their translation projects.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
