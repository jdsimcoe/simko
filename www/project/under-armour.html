UnderArmour.com is built on the MEAN-stack and it was my first large exposure to a large-scale Node environment.</p>
<h3>Web</h3><p>One of the biggest challenge was working within UnderArmour&#39;s massive Node framework to deliever a highly interactive parallax scrolling experience. Working in this environment meant building pages that had highly customized experiences with that had load of dependencies, modules and existing UI layers.</p>
<p>Our final solution had complicated direction, scroll targets and expected behavior. We used <a href="http://scrollmagic.io/">ScrollMagic</a> as it seemed to have the greatest flexibility to achieve the desired experience and satisfy the client&#39;s requirements.</p>
<p>We delivered a refresh of the technology page for the Winter 2014-2015 catalog that had customized animation and also worked seamlessly on tablet and mobile responsive breakpoints:</p>
<p><a href="">https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/technology</a></p>
<p>The project was considered a success as we used parallax to deliver a highly-customized experience for Under Armour.</p>
<p><em>NOTE</em>: While I am not a proponent of parallax scrolling for many reasons (among them it&#39;s overuse), this project does display being able to deliver a complex solution, leading other developers, and producing expected results to meet the client&#39;s expectations.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
