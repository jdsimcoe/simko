The project began as redesign of an old ASP site and encompassed a radical technology shift, as well as an important and much-needed re-invisioning of the Athey Creek brand from the ground up.</p>
<h3>Web</h3><p>The site is built on <a href="http://getsymphony.com/">Symphony</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, and the latest web technologies, including responsive design, icon fonts, retina images, and more. The site also features a custom CMS that allows for the management of hundreds of Events and thousands of teachings, comprising Athey&#39;s entire history of through-the-Bible sermons back through 1996. This is served up to the website both in dynamic pages as well as audio and video podcasts that are accessibly in the iTunes store.</p>
<p>The Athey Creek website is featured by Bootstrap in their <a href="http://expo.getbootstrap.com/">Expo</a>, a showcase of exemplary uses of their web framework.</p>
<h3>Design</h3><p>For Athey Creek I helped provide feedback and direction to another designer that built the new Athey branding. I have worked since then applying that branding in sermon artwork, event artwork, custom page artwork, and in Keynote presentations and other mediums.</p>
<p>Some of this artwork creation has also been supplemented with custom photography and editing to achieve a variety of visual styles within the greater branding framework.</p></section></article><footer><p class="copyright">&copy; 2013-2105.
