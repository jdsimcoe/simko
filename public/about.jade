        I am first a Christian and then a husband and father who strives to glorify God in all aspects of my life. I am a currently product designer for Circle. I have worked for the past several months rebranding Circle and applying this new brand direction to iOS app design, web design, print, and all other areas of the brand.
        
        Before Circle I have worked for the past couple years building a web consultancy, engaging in client work for UnderArmour.com, Mozo Shoes, The Gospel Coalition, Insignia Health, Redeemer Church, Dapper & Wise Roasters and other clients.

        I previously worked at WebMD Health Services where I helped push new standards like responsive design and adoption of HTML5 and CSS3 to produce better web experiences for clients. Prior to WebMD, I worked at the Waggener Edstrom Studio Dâ„¢ digital strategies practice, churning out creative web, digital and print work for clients such as Microsoft, Bing, Verizon, HTC, Sasquatch! Music Festival, Washington Roundtable, and the Jebsen Group.

        Before Waggener Edstrom, I worked for four years in the financial industry, where I was responsible for driving the marketing and creative output of an investment consultancy. This role involved crafting the web experiences, content, branding, and graphic design for the agency, as well as distilling complicated investment concepts into forms that were easily digested by clients and investors.

        I have worked on and off for the past seven years doing freelance Web, graphic and print design work, consulting on the creative process with startups and developing a passion to think beyond visual design in dreaming up rich and usable experiences for consumers.

        I have a passion for learning and am excited about the direction of the web, as well as how technologies such as HTML5 and mobile-first design are facilitating great content and taking on a variety of forms to reach new audiences. This site and my other projects embrace new technologies like [responsive design](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/), [SVG](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org), and more.

        ### About the Site

        This site was hand-coded in [Atom](http://atom.io/), styled with [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io) & [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/) on top of SASS, built on [Harp](http://harpjs.com/), versioned in [GitHub](https://github.com/), and hosted on [Surge](https://surge.sh/). Most photography was edited in Adobe Lightroom using the wonderful film packs from [Visual Supply Co. (VSCO)](http://vsco.co/store). Also I want to give a quick shout out to [Daniel Eden](https://daneden.me) for his wonderful [Animate.css](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) library, which I have custom ported to Sass as [Animate(d).sass](https://github.com/simko-io/animated.sass) for this site.
