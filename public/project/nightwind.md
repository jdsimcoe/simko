## Nightwind Productions

The Nightwind project was a small project for Nate DeCoste that encompassed a custom branding and a fresh, simple, responsive website to serve as a marketing site for his Christian publication company.

### Branding

Nate wanted a brand that captured nautical themes, as well as night-time and wind. I worked with the wind metaphor against a dark background to subtly represent both _wind_ and _night_. The logomark was taken from the wonderful [Climacons set from Adam Whitcroft](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/) and customized for Nightwind to align with their wordmark.

### Website

The website is built on [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), HTML5, and utilizes techniques such as responsive design and icon fonts. The site is fairly simple as Nightwind did not require any complex data manipulations to display their marketing text and content.
