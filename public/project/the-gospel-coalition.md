## The Gospel Coalition

[GHIJK](http://ghijk.co.uk/) reached out to me to participate in the front-end development of the The Gospel Coalition's 2015 National Conference website.

### Web

I was handed off assets for the 2015 Conference pages and I built them into static pages that were then integrated into a larger [Craft CMS](http://buildwithcraft.com/) installation. I developed the site in Sass via a custom Gulp flow that GHIJK helped developed that created a custom icon font from SVGs and also involved a social integration via [Sharrre](http://sharrre.com/) that tallied how many tweets and Facbook likes our page received.

Overall the project was a success in that we are able to, in a short amount of time, develop all of the pages and then get them plugged into a modern CMS that allowed TGC staff to manage the 100s of speakers, events, talks, and details of the 2015 National Conference in Florida.
