## The Gospel Coalition

I have worked on AtheyCreek.com for several years taking on the development of their XSLT-based front-end and MySQL-based backend. The project began as redesign of an old ASP site and encompassed a radical technology shift, as well as an important and much-needed re-invisioning of the Athey Creek brand from the ground up.

### Web

The site is built on [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and the latest web technologies, including responsive design, icon fonts, retina images, and more. The site also features a custom CMS that allows for the management of hundreds of Events and thousands of teachings, comprising Athey's entire history of through-the-Bible sermons back through 1996. This is served up to the website both in dynamic pages as well as audio and video podcasts that are accessibly in the iTunes store.

The Athey Creek website is featured by Bootstrap in their [Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/), a showcase of exemplary uses of their web framework.

### Design

For Athey Creek I helped provide feedback and direction to another designer that built the new Athey branding. I have worked since then applying that branding in sermon artwork, event artwork, custom page artwork, and in Keynote presentations and other mediums.

Some of this artwork creation has also been supplemented with custom photography and editing to achieve a variety of visual styles within the greater branding framework.
