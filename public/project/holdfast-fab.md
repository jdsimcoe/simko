## Holdfast Fabrications

Holdfast Fabriaction is a maker of fine, artisanal furniture in the Central Eastside of Portland, Oregon. I developed a concept for their branding that played on their industrial qualities and mimicked the shape of feel of solid furniture.

### Branding

The main exercise was to develop a branding direction that echoed the strength exuded by Holdfast Fabrication and their furniture. Even the name Holdfast brings to the mind images of something strong and rigid.

I brough the "H" and "F" together for the primary mark in a way that mimicked the shape of a chair or table but also showed the strength that I felt the Holdfast brand should carry.

From there the wordmark was just a further pushing this idea to build out the rest of the brand's look and feel. Overall, I wanted something modern and strong that would be memorable and easy to recognize and identify with Holdfast.
