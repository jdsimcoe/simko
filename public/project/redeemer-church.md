## Redeemer Church

Since Redeemer Church has transitioned from being Mars Hill Portland, to its own independent church in 2015, I have led and now serve on our church's creative team. I led an initiative to create our new branding along with input, direction, and contribution from other designers and team members.

Since then I have worked on sermon artwork, building the public website, and other creative endeavors.

### Web

For the website, I chose [Siteleaf](https://siteleaf.com/) as a platform because of its simple, static-site approach and its rich admin interface that allows other church staff and volunteers to easily update content, preview the content, and then push it live to the site.

Siteleaf has worked well and enabled our church to have a robust website, free hosting on GitHub, and rich expression without the overhead of a large CMS that needs to be custom-hosted on a server.

### Design

I have tried developing our design style cueing from the local feel of Portland, but also keeping the rich tradition and history of our church and our church building. The primary brand typeface, [Surveyor](http://www.typography.com/fonts/surveyor/overview/), shares a similar feel to a placard that was on the original church signage from the 1800s.

Gotham feels strong and solid and plays nicely with the handdrawn cross used in our primary logomark. The sermon artwork plays with the beautiful in-house photogrpahy we have, older woodcuts, and even modern hints to pop culture. All in all, the brand development has been organic and an expression of who our church is and where we live.
