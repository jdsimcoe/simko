## Under Armour

[Twin Technologies](https://www.twintechs.com/) engaged me a second time, to work with their dev teams building UnderArmour.com. UnderArmour.com is built on the MEAN-stack and it was my first large exposure to a large-scale Node environment.

### Web

One of the biggest challenge was working within UnderArmour's massive Node framework to deliever a highly interactive parallax scrolling experience. Working in this environment meant building pages that had highly customized experiences with that had load of dependencies, modules and existing UI layers.

Our final solution had complicated direction, scroll targets and expected behavior. We used [ScrollMagic](http://scrollmagic.io/) as it seemed to have the greatest flexibility to achieve the desired experience and satisfy the client's requirements.

We delivered a refresh of the technology page for the Winter 2014-2015 catalog that had customized animation and also worked seamlessly on tablet and mobile responsive breakpoints:

The project was considered a success as we used parallax to deliver a highly-customized experience for Under Armour.

*NOTE*: While I am not a proponent of parallax scrolling for many reasons (among them it's overuse), this project does display being able to deliver a complex solution, leading other developers, and producing expected results to meet the client's expectations.
