## Groove Game

I was contacted by [Human Design](http://beinghuman.is/) about working on a concept for Katasi for a safe-driving game that they were developed.

Ultimately, the game concept was called Groove.

### iOS App Concept

My role was to develop the UI and UX of several app screens for the game. This was my first foray into app design and I used Illustrator and Photoshop to develop out the screens. We didn't focus on onboarding or some of the more standard settings screens that might be featured in a larger project but most of the emphasis was on the main experience of the game.

We tried bringing game mechanics to the interface in a way that was fun, exciting, and would actually encourage drivers to use the game to earn rewards and in-turn drive safer.
