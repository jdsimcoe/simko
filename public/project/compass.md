## Compass

I began working for Compass in 2006 overseeing the output of their marketing department. I managed their websites which were built on HTML, CSS, and Adobe ColdFusion. This afforded me the opportunity to learn web languages, and begin to engage in implementing web standards best practices to optimize the speed performance, and architecture of the company's websites.

### Marketing

Marketing has always comprised the bulk of my work for Compass. Most investment consultancies and money managers use printed pitch books to sell their products to prospective investors. The bulk of my work was done in taking the Compass branding and evolving it, building beautiful books that could communicate very complicated and sophisticated techniques to prospective investors and clients.

This involved having a heavy hand in the shaping of content to craft messages that were cogent, passed compliance, and also creatively conveyed the ideas in a way that would be impactful for investors and help build the business.

### Recent Work

In recent years, I have worked with Compass to continue this legacy of adapting their branding to utilize better typography, more subtle use of whitespace, and also to continue to streamline their message to provide targeted communication to help their business succeed.
