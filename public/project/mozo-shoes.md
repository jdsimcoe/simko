## Mozo Shoes

I was contacted by [Twin Technologies](https://www.twintechs.com/) to participate and lead a small team to do a complete front-end overhaul of [MozoShoes.com](http://mozoshoes.com/).

### Web

This project was challenging in that we had the contraints of building the site on the [Demandware](http://www.demandware.com/) platform which has a workflow built around the Eclipse IDE. Running into walls with Eclipse syncing in OS X, we developed a modern Sass and JS-building workflow with Gulp, gulp-shell, and sycning files to the Demandware instance via [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) WebDAV.

The Gulp workflow enabled us to tackle the site design, moving Mozo away from Bootstrap and toward a modern Sass front-end utilizing [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) and other custom mixins.

The project proved to be a success and the Mozo team was stoked about the fresh new site, the new visuals, and a step forward for their brand and eCommerce site.
