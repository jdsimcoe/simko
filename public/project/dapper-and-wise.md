Dapper & Wise wanted a sleek, clean looking site with original photography to compliment their top-notch coffee roasting outfit in Beaverton, OR.

### The Site

The site is built on [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and is fully responsive, having optimized views, images, and functionality for computers, tablets, and mobile devices. We opted for single-page site to fit their streamlined content and a desire to keep things simple, clean and modern. On this project I moved their custom iconography and branding into an icon font to deliver crisp images regardless of device size and resolution.

### Custom Photography

A centerpiece to this project is the custom on-site photographic work. The D&W guys wanted some beautiful original photography to compliment the clean site and give their audience a good feel for what they are about. All of the photography on their site and much of the photography on their [Square store](https://squareup.com/market/dapper-and-wise-roasters) were done on-site as part of this initiative. We were able to successfully capture their signature feel and deliver on bringing their character and personality to the web.
