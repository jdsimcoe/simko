## Raleigh Hills Dental

Like much of my other work, the Raleigh Hills Dental website is built on [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and other technologies like HTML5, responsive design, and icon fonts. Custom work in the back-end architecture centered on their services, testimonials, and two custom contact forms that allow customers to submit responses for their desired appointment date and time.

The site is fully responsive and optimized for computer, tablet, and mobile devices, delivering an optimal experience regardless of the device or screen resolution. The photography was all done in house by Robert Rodriquez who takes some amazing photographs in his spare time.
