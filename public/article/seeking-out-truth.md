I don't know what is wrong with me, but I seriously enjoy the kids movie [*City of Ember*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/city-of-ember/id299413486) based on the science fiction series by Jeanne DuPrau of the same name.

There is something that is both haunting and fascinating about [the underground](http://www.theblogbelow.com/) that originally drew me to the movie and continues to hold me captive every time I watch it. Also, the movie is very stylized and very "designed", for lack of a better word. If you watch the movie, you will notice that the Builders possessed a keen sense of style and branding as everything they produce looks like it is set in [Futura Bold](http://www.typophile.com/node/12494) all caps.

This aside, more than its style, cinematography, and feel, the film is driven by a strong and engaging story. As many will attest to, the best movies are those that grab an audience and pull them into a story.

*City of Ember* tells the story of Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow and their search for a way of out of the underground, makeshift city of Ember. About halfway into the movie, after discovering some cryptic clues that seem to be written by the Builders, Doon says to Lina, "What if there's an exit to Ember?"

The rest of the movie puts the two on a whirlwind quest to unravel the mystery of Ember, searching for a way out of the dying city.

This quest is not unlike our own journey in life. Many say that we live in a dying world. Either the world is dying or we are all slowly on our way to death, but the truth is the same: someday all of us will leave this earth and step into something on the other side. Some believe that this step is a step into nothing. They believe we will all just cease to exist. Others (myself included) believe there is more to life after death.

Lina and Doon knew there was something beyond their small, dingy, underground city. The clues they found led them on a quest for truth. While the rest of Ember was content to continue singing as they had always done or lulled into a sense of peace and security by a brainwashing, power-hungry mayor, Lina and Doon discovered that there was a very startling truth that had been neglected and forgotten that would in reality change the course of their lives and shape the entire course of humanity. The clues they found pointed them to something greater.

> …even though we as secular people believe that beauty and love are just biochemical responses, in the presence of great art and beauty we inescapably feel that there *is* real meaning in life, there *is* truth and justice that will never let us down, and love means everything…We may, therefore, be secular materialists who believe truth and justice, good and evil, are complete illusions. But in the presence of art or even great natural beauty, our hearts tell us another story.

If we are honest with ourselves, there are clues all around us in our daily lives. In our design, in our work, in our hobbies and recreation, in our families, and in all of life we find clues that there is a reality that is bigger than us; a reality that we should live and give our lives for.

I believe that this quest for truth should be displayed in all that we do. As we discover and create on the web, we should be truth-seekers. We should be seeking the truth and using the tools that we are given to unveil and point to those deeper realities. If we are honest with our design, we will seek to build things that honor this quest for truth, instead of building mirrors that confuse our audience and mask the reality about what is important and what life is really about.
