In case you haven't noticed, I move this website to [Harp](http://harpjs.com/). There is no lack today of excellent static site generators. [Jekkyl](http://jekyllrb.com), [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io), [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io), [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com), [Statamic](http://statamic.com), and [Kirby](http://getkirby.com) are just a few of the options available to folks today.

The benefits to static sites are numerous. For one, they are much, much faster at loading content than database-driven sites. There is much less server overhead. Everything is stored in plain text files, usually with some kind of templating language like [YAML](http://yaml.org), [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com), [Haml](http://haml.info), [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com), or [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) to provide customized views of content. Many support CSS preprocessors like [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Less](http://lesscss.org), or [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for CSS as well as [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) for JS compiling.

All of this is fine and well but why did I land on Harp? Harp was something new. I heard about it in the closing sentence of an [article by Jordan Cauley](http://jordancauley.com/2013/10/27/anchor-vs-ghost/) and I was itching to learn some new technology. Most of the sites I build for clients are built on [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/). Symphony is a powerful and extensible PHP platform but I wanted to branch out and try something new. I have also been using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to compile assets for my projects. Harp does all this on the fly with a built-in preprocessor. Pages and articles can be compiled as Markdown or EJS or Jade templates that compile straight to HTML. It is incredibly fast and powerful and it supports some fairly robust templating out of the box.

Lastly Harp is built on [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and seems to be an emerging platform with lots of [work being invested](http://harpjs.com/blog/). I've realized that everybody has their favorite platform for various reasons. It would take a lifetime to understand and pick apart each one.

My goal here was not to argue for or against platforms for static sites. Rather, I wanted to share my journey and encourage you to go on journeys of your own. Explore. Break things. Tear things apart. See how they work. That is how you will grow and stretch yourself as a designer. Nothing happens in a sterile room, or a vacuum. Explore something new. Change your scenery and perspective. Uncover something you didn't know before. Challenge yourself to move outside your comfort zone. It will make you a better designer and a better person.
