## Determine

The goal of Determine since its 2012 inception has been to share Jesus Christ and His crucified and resurrected life with the world, to encourage and equip Christians to dwell in this truth daily as well as to lead not-yet-Christians into this reality.

During the course of the website's history it has moved twice. First it began as a Tumblr blog with a custom domain. Then it moved to a custom [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/) installation. Now it is back on Tumblr with an updated responsive theme. The site features original writing, photography, design work, and links to commentary on music, teachings, and video to inspire visitors.
