## Insomnia Coffee Co.

After finishing the successful launch of their roasterie's website ([Dapper & Wise](/work/dapper-and-wise-roasters/)), Evan and Tyler commissioned the work of a fresh new ground-up redesign of their Insomnia Coffee website. The project entailed from-scratch web design and original photography at their signature NW locations.

### The Site

The site is built on [Symphony](http://getsymphony.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), and other technologies like HTML5, responsive design, and icon fonts. It involved creating custom site sections for Events, Locations, and Images that are all tied together seamlessly.

The site is fully responsive and optimized for computer, tablet, and mobile devices, delivering an optimal experience regardless of the device or screen resolution.

### Photography

Producing engaging and original photography at their NW locations proved to be challenging. Finding customers and employees that can act natural and being able to successfully capture the feel and uniqueness of each location proved to be difficult but rewarding. Added into the mix was the fact that the three coffee shops were all photographed on the same beautiful summer day.

All in all we were able to build on the work done for Dapper & Wise and create a unique feel on the web for Insomnia's coffee shops.
