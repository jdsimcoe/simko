> So God created man in his own image,
  in the image of God he created him;
  male and female he created them.
> **Genesis 1:27**

We are made in God's image and God is the Creator of everything. He created us to be people that take His creation and make things with it.

That is what this blog is about. It is about craftsmanship, technology, and the act of creating things. My focus is on design since that is the trade that I work at and I aim to work at it for God's glory.

I am excited to share my thoughts and learnings and hopefully we can all grow together.

I <del>chose Symphony</del> moved to [Harp](http://harpjs.com) for this site's platform because it honors things that I have grown to appreciate, things like Markdown for marking up text, dead-simple NodeJS static site building, preprocessors like Sass, LESS, and Coffeescript and more. I'm excited to explore and push the limits of Harp as I write here and add content over the coming weeks and months.

Enjoy!
