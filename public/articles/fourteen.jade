  > For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. **Romans 8:14**

  I love it when a moment captures you and leads you along.

  My walk in NW Portland several years back created a convergence of spiritual crisis and artistic beautyâ€”both wrapped up in the same moment.

  I came across this beautiful Helvetica metal type on a warehouse in the outer-reaches of NW Portland. I also happened to be reading through Romans 8 on an afternoon walk. This verse struck like thunder and the lighting of the metal numbers made for a fantastic iPhone picture.

  I brought them together in this wallpaper to capture the moment. I just dusted it off and refreshed it to fit within the new site branding.

  Here is the download:
